        and started going back to his home.There was a bridge on the way to his home. When he started crossing it he saw
        his reflection in the water.</p>

        So he starting barking at his own reflection. <b>His bone fell in water as soon as he opened his mouth.</b> The
        greedy dog lost his bone.</p>
