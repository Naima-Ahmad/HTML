    <h1>Lion and the mouse</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, a lion was sleeping in a forest.
        A playful mouse saw the sleeping lion and jumped on him to play with his mane.
        The lion woke up from the disturbance and caught the mouse. He was about to crush the mouse to death.
        The mouse apologised for disturbing him and promised <i>he would help the lion in the future if he spared
            his life</i>.
        The lion accepted the deal and did not kill the mouse.</p>
    <p>One day the lion got caught in a hunter <sup>,</sup>s net. He couldn <sup>,</sup>t free himself and pleaded for help from anyone who
        could hear him. The mouse heard the lion <sup>,</sup>s cries and came for his help.
        The mouse chewed through the net <sup>,</sup>s wires with his sharp teeth to free the lion.
        The lion thanked the mouse, and <b>they became best friends.</b></p>
<p><b>Moral:</b> Do Good Have Good.</p>
