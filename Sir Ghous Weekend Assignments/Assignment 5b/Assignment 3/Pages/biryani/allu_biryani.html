    <h1>Allu biryani</h1>
    <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar
        dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.
        Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Pakistani online food ordering and delivery services, and has been
        labelled as the most popular dish overall in Pakistan.</p>
    <p>Who doesn't love a plate of flavourful Biryani? Biryani, an evergreen classic, really needs no introduction. It's
        aromatic, it's heavenly and one of the most loved delicacies not just in Pakistan but across the globe. It is
        believed that Mughals were the first to introduce biryani in Pakistan. whereas South India was exposed to its
        brilliance through the Arabs. Biryani flourished in some of the notable Muslim centres throughout the country -
        including Lucknow, old Delhi and Hyderabad, to name a few - after which it was gradually embraced by all.</p>
    <p>The Western part of the country bristles with a fantastic collection of Biryanis, one of the famous being the
        Bombay Biryani - a hearty combination of spices, meat and rice, studded with kewra. The Khojas and Boris Muslim
        communities kept alive the tradition of cooking Biryanis. When in Western India, one must try the Sindhi
        Biryani, Gujarati Biryani and Memoni Biryani. Aurangabad is also a centre where one can get a taste of Mughlai
        Biryani in Maharashtrian style.</p>
