    <h1>Wafer biscuits</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A wafer is a crisp, often sweet, very thin, flat, light biscuit,[1] often used to decorate ice cream, and
            also
            used as a garnish on some sweet dishes.</li>
        <li>Wafers can also be made into cookies with cream flavoring sandwiched between them (e.g., Oreo).</li>
        <li>They frequently have a waffle surface pattern but may also be patterned with insignia of the food's
            manufacturer or may be patternless.</li>
        <li>Some chocolate bars, such as Kit Kat and Coffee Crisp, are wafers with chocolate in and around them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Wafers, unlike other biscuits, are produced from a very fluid batter which is baked between heavy hot plates to
        produce thin sheets. Wafer offers a unique textural eating experience. The crispness and lightness blend
        admirably with soft cream or chocolate. Process control demands attention to sheet weight, moisture distribution
        and careful adjustment of the baking plate settings.</p>
    <p>Wafer is also the name given to the small round flatbreads that are used by Christian churches for celebrating
        the Eucharist. The Holy Wafer is the large biscuit taken by the clergy, while the Communion Wafers are the
        smaller pieces of biscuits given to the people during the Holy Communion. These Holy Wafers are special and they
        are made with images of the Holy Cross imprinted on them. </p>
