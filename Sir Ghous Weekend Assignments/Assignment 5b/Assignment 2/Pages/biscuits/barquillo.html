    <h1>Barquillo</h1>
    <p>Barquillo is a crispy rolled wafer pastry originating in Spain. It is made from the basic cookie ingredients of
        flour, sugar, egg whites and butter rolled out thinly and then shaped into a hollow cylinder or a cone. It was
        traditionally sold by roadside vendors known as barquilleros who carried a characteristic red roulette tin (the
        ruleta de barquillero). It was introduced to Latin America and the Philippines during colonial times. In Spain
        and former Spanish colonies, barquillos are commonly regarded as a type of Christmas cookie. It is also popular
        during various fiestas. It spread to neighboring countries and today is extremely popular in East and Southeast
        Asian countries.</p>
    <p>Barquillos are thin wafers made from flour, sugar, egg whites and butter that is rolled into the shape of a long
        hollow tube or a cone. They can also be sold simply folded over twice in a fan shape. In Spain, it was
        traditionally sold by roaming roadside vendors known as "barquilleros" (or "barquilleras") during festive
        events. In Madrid, barquilleros are particularly associated with the fiesta of San Isidro Labrador, where the
        vendors typically dress in castizo (chulapo) attire.</p>
