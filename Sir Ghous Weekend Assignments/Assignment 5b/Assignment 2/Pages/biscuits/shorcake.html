    <h1>Shortcake biscuit</h1>
    <p>Shortcake generally refers to a dessert with a crumbly scone like texture. There are multiple variations of
        shortcake most of which are usually served with fruit and cream, one of the most popular being strawberry
        shortcake which is typically served with whipped cream. Other variations common in the UK are Blackberry &
        clotted cream shortcake, and Lemon Berry Shortcake, which is served with lemon curd in place of cream.</p>
    <p>Shortcake is typically made with flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, salt, butter, milk or cream, and sometimes
        eggs. The dry ingredients are blended, and then the butter is cut in until the mixture resembles cornmeal. The
        liquid ingredients are then mixed in just until moistened, resulting in a shortened dough. The dough is then
        dropped in spoonfuls onto a baking sheet, rolled and cut like baking powder biscuits, or poured into a cake pan,
        depending on how wet the dough is and the baker's preferences. Then it is baked at a relatively high temperature
        until set</p>
