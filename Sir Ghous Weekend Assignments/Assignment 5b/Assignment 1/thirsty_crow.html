    <h1>Thirsty Crow</h1>
    <p>Once there was a crow flying in the sky. It was hot summer and he felt thirsty. He looked for water here and
        there. But he could not find any water.</p>
    <p>At last he saw a pot with a little water at the bottom of it. He tried, but could not reach the water. He got an
        idea to rise up the water level. So, he picked up the small stones nearby and dropped them into the pot one by one. Now the water rose up. He drink water and flew away happily.</p>
