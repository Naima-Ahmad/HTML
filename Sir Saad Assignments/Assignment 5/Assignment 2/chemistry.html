    <dt><b>Physical chemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>The branch of chemistry concerned with the application of the techniques and theories of physics to the study of
        chemical systems.</dd>
    <dt><b>Organic chemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, reactions, and preparation of
        carbon-containing compounds.</dd>
    <dt><b>Inorganic chemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>Inorganic chemistry is concerned with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds, which include metals,
        minerals, and organometallic compounds.</dd>
    <dt><b>Biochemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>Biochemistry is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at the cellular and molecular
        level.</dd>
    <dt><b>Analytical chemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the
        composition and structure of matter,</dd>
    <dt><b>Environmental chemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>Environmental chemistry is the study of the effects that chemicals have on the air, water and soil and how they impact the environment and
        human health.</dd>
    <dt><b>Industrial chemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>Industrial chemistry is the process of transforming matter into materials that are useful to humanity through chemical processes.</dd>
    <dt><b>Nuclear chemistry:</b></dt>
    <dd>Nuclear chemistry is the subdiscipline of chemistry that is concerned with changes in the nucleus of elements.
