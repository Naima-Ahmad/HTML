    <h1>Burger</h1>
    <p>Burger King (BK) is an American-based multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. Headquartered in
        Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Florida–based
        restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties, its two Miami-based franchisees David
        Edgerton and James McLamore purchased the company in 1959 and renamed it "Burger
        King". Over the next half-century, the company changed hands four times and its third set of owners, a
        partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, took it public in 2002. In late
        2010, 3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company, in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. The
        new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, along with partner
        Berkshire Hathaway, eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons, under the
        auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.</p>
    <p>The 1970s were the "Golden Age" of the company's advertising, but beginning in the early 1980s, Burger King
        advertising began losing focus. A series of less successful advertising campaigns created by a procession of
        advertising agencies continued for the next two decades. In 2003, Burger King hired the Miami-based advertising
        agency Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B), which completely reorganized its advertising with a series of new
        campaigns centered on a redesigned Burger King character nicknamed "The King", accompanied by a new online
        presence. While highly successful, some of CP+B's commercials were derided for perceived sexism or cultural
        insensitivity. Burger King's new owner, 3G Capital, later terminated the relationship with CP+B in 2011 and
        moved its advertising to McGarryBowen, to begin a new product-oriented campaign with expanded demographic
        targeting.</p>
    <p>Burger King's menu has expanded from a basic offering of burgers, French fries, sodas, and milkshakes to a larger
        and more diverse set of products. In 1957, the "Whopper" became the first major addition to the menu, and it has
        become Burger King's signature product since. Conversely, Burger King has introduced many products which failed
        to catch hold in the marketplace. Some of these failures in the United States have seen success in foreign
        markets, where Burger King has also tailored its menu for regional tastes. From 2002 to 2010, Burger King
        aggressively targeted the 18–34 male demographic with larger products that often carried correspondingly large
        amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats. This tactic would eventually damage the company's financial
        underpinnings, and cast a negative pall on its earnings. Beginning in 2011, the company began to move away from
        its previous male-oriented menu and introduce new menu items, product reformulations and packaging, as part of
        its current owner 3G Capital's restructuring plans of the company.</p>
    <p>As of December 31, 2018, Burger King reported that it had 17,796 outlets in 100 countries. Of these, nearly
        half are located in the United States, and 99.7% are privately owned and operated, with its new owners moving
        to an almost entirely franchised model in 2013. Burger King has historically used several variations of
        franchising to expand its operations. The manner in which the company licenses its franchisees varies depending
        on the region, with some regional franchises, known as master franchises, responsible for selling franchise
        sub-licenses on the company's behalf. Burger King's relationship with its franchises has not always been
        harmonious. Occasional spats between the two have caused numerous issues, and in several instances, the
        company's and its licensees' relations have degenerated into precedent-setting court cases. Burger King's
        Australian franchise Hungry Jack's is the only franchise to operate under a different name, due to a trademark
        dispute with a similarly-named restaurant in Adelaide, South Australia and a series of legal cases between the
        two.[citation ne</p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The predecessor to Burger King was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. After
        visiting the McDonald brothers' original store location in San Bernardino, California, the founders and owners
        (Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns), who had purchased the rights to two pieces of equipment
        called "Insta-machines", opened their first restaurants. Their production model was based on one of the machines
        they had acquired, an oven called the "Insta-Broiler". This strategy proved to be so successful that they later
        required all of their franchises to use the device. After the company faltered in 1959, it was purchased
        by its Miami, Florida, franchisees, James McLamore and David R. Edgerton. They initiated a corporate
        restructuring of the chain, first renaming the company Burger King. They ran the company as an independent
        entity for eight years (eventually expanding to over 250 locations in the United States), before selling it to
        the Pillsbury Company in 1967</p>
    <p>Pillsbury's management tried several times to restructure Burger King during the late 1970s and the early 1980s.
        The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help
        revamp the company. In a plan called "Operation Phoenix", Smith restructured corporate business
        practices at all levels of the company. Changes included updated franchise agreements, a broader
        menuand new standardized restaurant designs. Smith left Burger King for PepsiCo in 1980
        shortly before a system-wide decline in sales.</p>
    <p>Pillsbury's Executive Vice President of Restaurant Operations Norman E. Brinker was tasked with turning the brand
        around, and strengthening its position against its main rival McDonald's. One of his initiatives was a new
        advertising campaign featuring a series of attack ads against its major competitors. This campaign started a
        competitive period between Burger King, McDonald's, and top burger chains known as the Burger wars. Brinker
        left Burger King in 1984, to take over Dallas-based gourmet burger chain Chili's.</p>
    <p>Smith and Brinker's efforts were initially effective, but after their respective departures, Pillsbury
        relaxed or discarded many of their changes, and scaled back on construction of new locations. These actions
        stalled corporate growth and sales declined again, eventually resulting in a damaging fiscal slump for Burger
        King and Pillsbury. Poor operation and ineffectual leadership continued to bog down the company for many
        years.</p>
    <p>Pillsbury was eventually acquired by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan in 1989.
        Initially, Grand Met attempted to bring the chain to profitability under newly minted CEO Barry Gibbons; the
        changes he initiated during his two-year tenure had mixed results, as successful new product introductions and
        tie-ins with The Walt Disney Company were offset by continuing image problems and ineffectual advertising
        programs. Additionally, Gibbons sold off several of the company's assets in an attempt to profit from their
        sale and laid off many of its staff members.

        Burger King's headquarters experienced major damage in 1992 from Hurricane Andrew.

        After Gibbon's departure, a series of CEOs each tried to repair the company's brand by changing the menu,
        bringing in new ad agencies and many other changes. The parental disregard of the Burger King brand
        continued with Grand Metropolitan's merger with Guinness in 1997 when the two organizations formed the holding
        company Diageo. Eventually, the ongoing systematic institutional neglect of the brand through a string of
        owners damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business, and its total value
        was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the money-losing chain and put
        the company up for sale in 2000.</p>
    <p>The 21st century saw the company return to independence when it was purchased from Diageo by a group of
        investment firms led by TPG Capital for US$1.5 billion in 2002. The new owners rapidly moved to
        revitalize and reorganize the company, culminating with the company being taken public in 2006 with a highly
        successful initial public offering. The firms' strategy for turning the chain around included a new
        advertising agency and new ad campaigns, a revamped menu strategy, a series of programs designed
        to revamp individual stores, a new restaurant concept called the BK Whopper Bar, and a new design format
        called These changes successfully re-energized the company, leading to a score of profitable
        quarters. Yet, despite the successes of the new owners, the effects of the financial crisis of 2007–2010
        weakened the company's financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor McDonald's grew. The
        falling value of Burger King eventually led to TPG and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a
        US$3.26 billion sale to 3G Capital of Brazil. Analysts from financial firms UBS and Stifel Nicolaus
        agreed that 3G would have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. After the deal
        was completed, the company's stock was removed from the New York Stock Exchange, ending a four-year period as a
        public company. The delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental
        business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's without having to worry about pleasing
        shareholders. In the United States domestic market, the chain has fallen to third place in terms of same
        store sales behind Ohio-based Wendy's. The decline is the result of 11 consecutive quarters of same store sales
        decline.</p>
    <p>In August 2014, 3G announced that it planned to acquire the Canadian restaurant and coffee shop chain Tim Hortons
        and merge it with Burger King with backing from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The two chains will retain
        separate operations post-merger, with Burger King remaining in its Miami headquarters. A Tim Hortons
        representative stated that the proposed merger would allow Tim Hortons to leverage Burger King's resources for
        international growth. The combined company will be the third-largest international chain of fast food
        restaurants. The deal lead to a controversy over the practice of tax inversions, in which a company
        decreases the amount of taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a tax haven, a country with lower rates but
        maintains the majority of their operations in their previous location. As a high-profile instance of tax
        inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss
        of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against
        inversions.

        In 2019, Burger King reported that it planned to close up to 250 low-volume locations per year, with closures
        coming into effect in 2020.

        In February 2021, Burger King began testing a customer loyalty rewards program called "Royal Perks" in Los
        Angeles, Miami, New York City, New Jersey and Long Island, New York.

        In March 2022, Burger King suspended all its corporate support, including operations, marketing, supply chain,
        investments and expansion in Russia in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. It halted its corporate
        support to the more than 800 fully franchised restaurant chains in Russia managed by a local master
        franchisee. However, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism revealed that Burger King
        retained its stake in the Russian franchises through an offshore joint venture with the Russian state-owned VTB
        Bank and a Ukrainian investment firm linked to corrupt deals with Ukraine's former pro-Russian leader.</p>
