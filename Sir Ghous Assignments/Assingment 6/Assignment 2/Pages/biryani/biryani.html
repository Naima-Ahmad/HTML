    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made with vegetables,
        rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, and fish), or in some cases without any
        meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.</p>
    <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar
        dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia.[3]
        Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Pakistani online food ordering and delivery services, and has been
        labelled as the most popular dish overall in Pakistan.</p>
    <h4>Etymology</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian: برنج), the Persian word for rice. Another theory
        states that it is derived from biryan or beriyan (Persian: بریان), which means "to fry" or "to roast". It
        may alternatively be related to the Persian word bereshtan (Persian: برشتن) which also means "to roast
        (onions)", as the dish is often prepared by flavouring rice with fried onions and meat, besides mild spices.</p>
    <h4>Origin</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim
        centres of Delhi (Mughlai cuisine), Rampur, Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small principalities. In South
        India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from
        Hyderabad Deccan (where some believe the dish originated) as well as Tamil Nadu (Ambur, Thanjavur,
        Chettinad, Salem, Dindigal), Kerala (Malabar), Telangana, and Karnataka (Bhatkal) where Muslim communities were
        present.</p>
    <p>According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire
        (1526–1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian pilaf. Indian restaurateur
        Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the Mughals.</p>
    <p>Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered
        India. The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao):
        it states that the word "biryani" is of older usage in India. A similar theory, that biryani came to India
        with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his
        native land during that period.</p>
    <p>According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf
        varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in
        medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the
        dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between "pulao" and "biryani"
        being arbitrary.</p>
    <p>According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes
        from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.</p>
    <p>There are various apocryphal stories dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished
        historian, says she could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is
        not her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other historians who
        have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear around the 18th century.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Ingredients for biryani vary according to the region and the type of meat and vegetables used. Meat (of either
        chicken, goat, beef, lamb, prawn or fish) is the prime ingredient with rice. As is common in dishes of the
        Indian subcontinent, vegetables are sometimes also used when preparing biryani. Corn may be used depending on
        the season and availability. Navratan biryani tends to use sweeter, richer ingredients such as cashews, kismis
        and fruits, such as apples and pineapples.</p>
    <p>The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace,
        pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green
        chilies, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron.</p>
    <p>The main ingredient that usually accompanies the spices is chicken or goat meat; special varieties might use beef
        or seafood instead. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of aubergine
        (brinjal), boiled egg, and salad.</p>
    <h4>Preparation styles</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>Biryani can be cooked using one of two styles/techniques, pakki ("cooked") and kacchi ("raw").</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a pakki biryani, the rice, marinated meat, and any vegetables are partially ("three-quarters") cooked
            separately, before being combined into layers in a cooking vessel. Different layers of rice may be treated
            with different spices (e.g., with dissolved saffron or turmeric to give the rice different colours and
            flavours). <br>The contents are then baked to complete the cooking and allow the flavours to combine.
            Alternatively, the components may be fully cooked, and then simply combined by layering before serving.
        </li>
        <li>In a kacchi biryani, layers of raw marinated meat are alternated in layers with wet, pre-soaked, raw rice
            (which may be treated with different spices as above), and cooked together by baking, or medium-to-low
            direct heat (typically, for at least an hour). Cooking occurs by a process of steaming from the ingredients'
            own moisture: the cooking vessel's lid is sealed (traditionally, with a strip of wheat dough) so that steam
            cannot escape (proper dum pukht).

            A yoghurt-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot provides additional flavour and moisture. Potatoes
            often comprise the bottom layer (a technique also used in Iranian cuisine), because, with their natural
            moisture content, they brown well with less risk of getting burned accidentally. The lid is not opened until
            the dish is ready to serve. Kacchi biryani is technically much more demanding and time-consuming than pakki
            biryani, for the following reasons:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The different ingredients—meat, rice, potatoes—have different cooking times: tender cuts of meat/chicken
                can be fully cooked well before the rice is done. To prevent this, many kacchi recipes use parboiled
                (semi-cooked) rice rather than raw rice.</li>
            <li>If direct heat is used, there is a risk that the food layer in contact with the vessel bottom may get
                burned while the interior's contents are still raw. This risk is minimized by sustained baking with
                moderate heat or very slow cooking on low direct heat. This approach, however, increases cooking time
                considerably.</li>
            <li>One method is cooking the dish "blind", with the cooking vessel sealed, so one cannot monitor the
                cooking progress—it takes the understanding of the raw foods used, the heat required to cook those raw
                foods, and how the climate can affect the cooking process. Hence making kacchi biryani requires a
                seasoned hand.</li>
        </ul>
