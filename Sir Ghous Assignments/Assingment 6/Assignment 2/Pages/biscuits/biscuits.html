    <h1>Biscuit</h1>
    <p>A biscuit is a flour-based baked and shaped food product. In most countries biscuits are typically hard, flat,
        and unleavened. They are usually sweet and may be made with sugar, chocolate, icing, jam, ginger, or cinnamon.
        They can also be savoury, similar to crackers. Types of biscuit include sandwich biscuits, digestive biscuits,
        ginger biscuits, shortbread biscuits, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, Anzac
        biscuits, biscotti, and speculaas.</p>
    <p>In most of North America, nearly all hard sweet biscuits are called "cookies", while the term "biscuit" is used
        for a soft, leavened quick bread similar to a less sweet version of a scone.</p>
    <h4>Variations in meaning of <i>biscuit</i></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In most of the English-speaking world, a "biscuit" is a small, hard baked product that would be called
            either a "cookie" or a "cracker" in the United States and sometimes in Canada. "Biscuits" in the United
            Kingdom, the Isle of Man, and Ireland are usually hard and may be savoury or sweet, such as chocolate
            biscuits, digestives, hobnobs, ginger nuts, rich tea, shortbread, bourbons, and custard creams. The term
            "cookie" typically refers to only one type of biscuit (the sweeter baked dough typically containing
            chocolate chips or raisins); however, it may also locally refer to specific types of biscuits or breads.
        </li>
        <li>In the United States and some parts of Canada, a "biscuit" is a quick bread, somewhat similar to an
            unsweetened scone, but with a texture more 'fluffy and flaky' vs. 'sturdy and crumbly'. Biscuits may be
            referred to as either "baking powder biscuits" or "buttermilk biscuits" if buttermilk is used rather than
            milk as a liquid, as buttermilk is not only flavorful but acidic (allowing use of baking soda vs. baking
            powder which is a mixture of baking soda with an acidifier and buffer). A Southern regional variation using
            the term "beaten biscuit" (or in New England "sea biscuit") is closer to hardtack than soft dough biscuits
        </li>
        <li>In Canada, the term "biscuit" can simultaneously refer to what is commonly identified as a biscuit in either
            the United Kingdom or the United States. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary describes each word in reference to
            the other; "biscuit" can mean "Brit. a cookie", whilst "cookie" can mean "N. Amer. a small sweet biscuit".
            "Tea biscuit" is also a standard Canadianism for the "North American" biscuit.</li>
