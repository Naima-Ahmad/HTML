    <h1>Pineapple cake</h1>
    <p>Pineapple cake is a Taiwanese sweet traditional pastry and dessert containing butter, flour, egg, sugar, and
        pineapple jam or slices.</p>
    <p>Both pineapple cake and pineapple tart likely came into fruition around the 16th century when the pineapple, a
        fruit native to South America, was introduced by Portuguese merchants to the region. Around this time, the
        Portuguese established a presence in places such as Malacca, Singapore and Taiwan, which they referred to as now
        archaic name "Formosa" for the island.</p>
    <p>During the Japanese colonial era, the pineapple fruit became a critical component of Taiwan's economy during
        which Japanese industrialists imported a wide variety of pineapple cultivars and established numerous processing
        plants.</p>
    <p>By the late 1930s, Taiwan had become the third-largest exporter of pineapples in the world. However, when
        pineapple production in Taiwan shifted toward domestic sales and use of fresh pineapple, local bakeries sought
        to use this surplus in pastries. While pineapple cakes had historically been produced as a ceremonial food, a
        combination of governmental promotion and globalization popularized the pineapple cake. Pineapple cakes have
        become one of the top-selling souvenirs in Taiwan</p>
