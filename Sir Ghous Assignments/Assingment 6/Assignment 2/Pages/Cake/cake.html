    <h1>Cake</h1>
    <P>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. In their oldest
        forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or
        elaborate, and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</P>
    <p>Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and
        birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are
        centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into
        cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so
        that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.</p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of Viking origin, from the Old Norse word "kaka".</p>
    <p>Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread"
        were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking,
        while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.</p>
    <p>The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as butter, oil or margarine), a liquid, and a
        leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder.</p>
