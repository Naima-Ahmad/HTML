    <h1>Sponge cake</h1>
    <p>Sponge cake is a light cake made with egg whites, flour and sugar.The sponge cake is thought to be one of the
        first of the non-yeasted cakes, and the earliest attested sponge cake recipe in English is found in a book by
        the English poet Gervase Markham, The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to
        Be in a Complete Woman.</p>
    <p>Sponge cakes became the cake recognized today when bakers started using beaten eggs as a rising agent in the
        mid-18th century. The Victorian creation of baking powder by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843
        allowed the addition of butter to the traditional sponge recipe, resulting in the creation of the Victoria
        sponge. Cakes are available in many flavours and have many recipes as well. Sponge cakes have become snack cakes
        via the Twinkie.</p>
