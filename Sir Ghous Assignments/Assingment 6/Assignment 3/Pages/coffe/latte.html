    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—sand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped
        with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
    <p>The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the
        term patty is rarely used or can even refer to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually implies beef, for
        clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef burger, turkey burger,
        bison burger, pit a chickefast-food restaurants, diners, and other restaurants. There are many
        international and regional variations of hamburger.</p>
