    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
        eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order,
        with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from
        a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding
        hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury</p>
    <p>Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At least one credible report exists of a
        young fox killed by hens.[32][33][34] If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, it may puff
        up its feathers.</p>
    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
        Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
        subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt
        in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria
        and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III. They are known in ancient Greece from
        the 5th century BC.</p>
    <h4>Etymology</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
        as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock, and is widely used
        throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.</p>
    <h4>Embryology</h4>
    <p>Chicken embryos have long been used as model organisms to study developing embryos. Large numbers of embryos can
        be provided by commercial chicken farmers who sell fertilized eggs which can be easily opened and used to
        observe the developing embryo. Equally important, embryologists can carry out experiments on such embryos, close
        the egg again and study the effect later on. For instance, many important discoveries in the area of limb
        development have been made using chicken embryos, such as the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge and the
        zone of polarizing activity by John W. Saunders.</p>
    <h4>Physiology</h4>
    <p>Populations of chickens from high-altitude regions like Tibet have special physiological adaptations that result
        in a higher hatching rate in low oxygen environments. When eggs are placed in a hypoxic environment, chicken
        embryos from these populations express much more hemoglobin than embryos from other chicken populations. This
        hemoglobin also has a greater affinity for oxygen, allowing hemoglobin to bind to oxygen more readily.</p>
    <p>Although all avians appear to have lost TLR9, artificial immunity against bacterial pathogens has been induced in
        neonatal chicks by Taghavi et al. 2008 using tailored oligodeoxynucleotides.</p>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>The American English expression "fried chicken" was first recorded in the 1830s, and frequently appears in
        American cookbooks of the 1860s and 1870s.[1] The origin of fried chicken in the southern states of America has
        been traced to precedents in Scottish and West African cuisine. Scottish fried chicken was
        cooked in fat, and West African fried chicken added different seasonings, and was battered
        and cooked in palm oil. Scottish frying techniques and African seasoning techniques were used in the American
        South by enslaved Africans.</p>
    <p>Before the industrialization of chicken production and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken, only young
        spring chickens (pullets or cockerels) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of
        frying making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer. Older, tougher birds require longer cooking times at
        lower temperatures. To compensate for this, sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender, allowed to cool
        and dry, and then fried.</p>
