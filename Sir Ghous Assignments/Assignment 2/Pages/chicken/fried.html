    <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
    <p>Fried chicken, also known as Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated
        with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp
        coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most
        commonly used.</p>
    <p>The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages.
        However, the Scottish were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat. Meanwhile, many West African
        peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil).
        Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African
        Americans in the American South.</p>
    <p>Generally, chickens are not fried whole. Instead, the chicken is divided into its constituent pieces. The
        white meat sections are the breast and the wings from the front of the chicken, while the dark meat sections are
        the thighs and legs or "drumsticks" from the rear of the chicken. The breast is typically split into two pieces,
        and the back is usually discarded. Chicken fingers, which are boneless pieces of chicken breast cut into
        long strips, are also commonly used</p>
